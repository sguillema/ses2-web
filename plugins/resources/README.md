# RESOURCES

**This directory is not required, you can delete it if you don't want to use it.**

This directory contains any local and custom resources/utilities to be used by the client and server via. plugin (parent folder) using injection to app or server context, or externally using a direct import to files in this directory.

The pattern is to use injection as a plugin as first preference.

This was made by Sebastian Guillema.
